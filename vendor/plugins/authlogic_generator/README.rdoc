= AuthlogicGenerator

Generates an authentication system with Ben Johnsons awesome Authlogic plugin/gem as seen in his basic tutorial at: http://www.binarylogic.com/2008/11/3/tutorial-authlogic-basic-setup

The generator supports Erb and Haml, Test::Unit and Rspec.

Yeah I know it is Authlogics intention not to have a generator. But I personally like to have a scaffold as a starting point for any further customization wherever possible. 


== What this generator creates for you

* UserSession / User model and corresponding controller
* Login form, views for the user management (Rrb or Haml)
* Some nice looking routes
* Basic test coverage (Test::Unit or Rspec)


== Installation

	$ script/plugin install git://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic.git
	$ script/plugin install git://github.com/masone/authlogic_generator.git


== Usage

1. Run the generator

	$ script/generate authlogic [--rspec] [--haml]

2. Run the database migrations

	$ rake db:migrate

3. Have a look at the generated stuff...

	Login is at:          /login
	Login is at:          /logout
	Signup is at:         /signup
	Users account is at:	/account


== Notes

* The plugin has been written for Rails 2.3
* The generator will not run properly if you already have a user model
