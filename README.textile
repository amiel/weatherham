* Some usage copy (hover over lines for more information and correct timezone...)


* wind direction graphs
* have a global that represents the next update time, it can be displayed to the user, and all js assets can expire at that time
* Panning
** indicate "Last Observation" for current panned state
** indication of current day
* fix flot so that the horizontal scale is in PST not UTC
* display relevant metrics (maxes and mins for interesting things)
* the entire javascript could use a refactor
* wrote a compression script, that runs on the daily cron, done, but the following fixes will be needed
** yearly and monthly are having problems, do they reveal a bug that the others have as well?
